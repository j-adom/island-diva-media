>“I’m not living for myself. I’m living for my legacy.” <cite>― Danielle James</cite>

Danielle James is a New York City based, Trinidadian-American fashion and retail entrepreneur, consultant, creative director, model, journalist, and host. She is an active part of the new Harlem Renaissance.

An industry insider and fashion tastemaker, Danielle is looked to as a style authority and source of inspiration. She served as a Thought Leader and Contributor to the Huffington Post on matters of retail, fashion, style, and technology. She also headed up Fashion and Beauty and Editorial Partnerships for iONE Women’s Division — comprising of Hello Beautiful, and Madame Noire.

Danielle is the founder of Model Citizen: a peer-to-peer shopping platform that allows women to shop each others’ closets for rentals and sales based on height and body type. Textile waste is the second largest polluter, next to oil, on our planet and Danielle believes in sustainable shopping and disrupting the way we consume clothing. According to the Wall Street Journal, we only wear 20% of our closets — Model Citizen allows you to monetize the other 80%. Women nationwide are monetizing their closets while saving money. Rent, rock, and return with MC!

Danielle began her career in merchandising on the strategy side — working to explore fashion ideas and concepts on a regional and national scale as well as bringing fashion to niche communities through tailored assortments. She then became a buyer for a major Fortune 500 Company, where she focused on RTW, fashion accessories, handbags, and shoes. She sat on internal boards focusing on women, diversity and presence of minority designers in store. She also focused on bridging the gap between retail and technology within Millennial customers.

Danielle is a business and brand consultant, specializing in retail and beauty, working with a range of clients from startups to large enterprises. She provides businesses and individuals with the necessary tools and education to start, grow, specialize and succeed. Her approach incorporates a foundation of knowledge, connecting through passion, paired with the understanding of limitless thinking.

A Duke University graduate with degrees in Psychology and Public Policy, Danielle moved to NYC as a fashion model, gracing the pages of Essence Magazine, and O Magazine, working with clients like Bloomingdales and Macy’s, and being featured on The Today Show and Good Morning America.

Danielle has given keynote addresses on the importance of body image and self-esteem. She works closely within the Harlem community to promote positive body image among girls, and works with under-served students to excite them about their education. Furthermore, she speaks at events focused on women, technology, fashion, and beauty. She enjoys hosting fashion shows and speaking on camera about fashion, beauty, pop culture, and entrepreneurship. 

In her free time, she enjoys traveling, cooking, reading, as well as spending time with her close friends and family.
